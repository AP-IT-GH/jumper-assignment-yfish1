# How to train an ML Agent to jump over oncoming obstacles

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to train an ML Agent to successfully jump over oncoming obstacles using Unity and MLAgents. This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough to achieve this outcome.

## Requirements

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

- Unity Hub (version 3.7.0)
- Unity Editor (version 2022.3.19f)
- MLAgents package (Python)
- Anaconda environment with MLAgent setup

## Creating a Project

1. **Open Unity Hub**:
   - Launch Unity Hub.
   - Click on "New project."

2. **Project setup**:
   - Choose a project name and location.
   - Select Unity Editor version 2022.3.19f.

2. **Import MLAgents**:
   - In Unity, go to `Window > Package Manager`.
   - Select `Packages: Unity Registry` and find `ML Agents`. Click `Install` to add it to your project.

## Creating a Single-Player Game

1. **Create following objects**:
   - Ensure that every object has the right tags and naming.
   - You can use the pictures below to fill in the parameters.

2. **Create prefab**:
   - Convert the obstacle object into a prefab.

3. **Set up MLPlayer**:
   - Attach a `Rigidbody` component to the MLPLayer object.
   - Create a new script named `MLPlayer` and attach it to the player.
   - Use the code from file (link to MLPlayer.cs file).
   - Change the Behavior Name to `MLPlayer`.

4. **Obstacle behavior**:
   - Create an obstacle script for obstacle objects to define their movement and behavior.
   - Use the code from file (link to Obstacle.cs file).

5. **Spawner script**:
   - Create a Spawner script and attach it to the road object.
   - Use the code from file (link to Spawner.cs file).

6. **Setup spawning points and prefab**:
   - Define spawn points (`SpawnPt` and `WallEnd`) within the road object.
   - Drag the obstacle prefab into the prefab field in the spawner script.
   - Link spawnpt to the spawn point in the spawner script.

7. **Add WallReward object to the obstacle prefab**:

8. **MLPlayer Configuration**:
    - Add a `Decision Requester` component to the MLPlayer object.
    - Adjust the `Decision Period` to control decision-making frequency.

10. **Sensor setup**:
    - Configure a `Ray Perception Sensor 3D` on the MLPlayer.
    - Adjust settings (e.g., ray angles, distance) to enable obstacle detection.
    - Make sure to change the `Z Rotation` to 90.

## Let's train the Agent

1. **Open your project in the mlagents environment terminal**:
   - Once open, use following comman
  ```bash
   mlagents-learn
```
2. **Once ready, the terminal will notify you when you can start your project in Unity**
